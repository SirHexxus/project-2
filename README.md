## **Description**

The Stitches and Tape (S&T) measurement tracker is a simplified, yet dynamic, tracking tool. It allows you, the Clothier, to store and track all the measurements you might need to create anything from a simple shirt to a bespoke suit and everything else in-between for your clientele. Athleisure ware, business suits, cosplay, evening gowns, you'll have the needed measurements at the click of a button instead of wading through folders of measurement sheets.

Whether you're a novice designer or an experienced Clothier, S&T is the perfect tool. Unlike most measurement tracking tools on the market, S&T, provides you with a large scope measurement tracking. S&T offers you a selection of generic measurements, 50 measurements to track, and 5 custom measurements! You have the option to track these measurements in inches or centimeters (whichever best suits your needs). Also, you can capture any notes to relating to your client!
