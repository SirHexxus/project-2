          The Stitches and Tape (S&T) measurement tracker is a simplified, yet
          dynamic, tracking tool. It allows you, the Clothier, to store and
          track all the measurements you might need to create anything from a
          simple shirt to a bespoke suit and everything else in-between for your
          clientele. Athleisure ware, business suits, cosplay, evening gowns,
          you'll have the needed measurements at the click of a button instead
          of wading through folders of measurement sheets.
        </p>

          Whether you're a novice designer or an experienced Clothier, S&T is
          the perfect tool. Unlike most measurement tracking tools on the
          market, S&T, provides you with a large scope measurement tracking. S&T
          offers you a selection of generic measurements, 50 measurements to
          track, and 5 custom measurements! You have the option to track these
          measurements in inches or centimeters (whichever best suits your
          needs). Also, you can capture any notes to relating to your client!
