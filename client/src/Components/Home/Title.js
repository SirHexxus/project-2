            The Stitches and Tape (S&T) measurement tracker is a simplified, yet
            dynamic, tracking tool. It allows you, the Clothier, to store and
            track all the measurements you might need to create anything from a
            simple shirt to a bespoke suit and everything else in-between for
            your clientele. Athleisure ware, business suits, cosplay, evening
            gowns, you'll have the needed measurements at the click of a button
            instead of wading through folders of measurement sheets.

            Whether you're a novice designer or an experienced Clothier, S&T is
            the perfect tool. Unlike most measurement tracking tools on the
            market, S&T, provides you with large scope measurement tracking. S&T
            offers you a selection of generic measurements, 50 measurements to
            track, and 5 custom measurements! You have the option to track these
            measurements in inches or centimeters (whichever best suits your
            needs). Also, you can capture any notes to relating to your client!
